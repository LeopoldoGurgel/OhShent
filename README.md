# Oh Shent! creative programming

## Description
Basically Oh Shent! is my WebDeveloper portfolio. A sample of what I can develop with my skills combined with creativity and awesomeness. In this project, as well as the projects shown in this webpage, you will see good examples of what I can develop combining the programming languages I seek to improve everyday, such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MARKDOWN, etc. I hope you get as impressed as I hope you will.

In case you're asking yourself, the name OhShent! was inspired by a Brazillian expression, "Oxente", very common in some northeastern parts of the country and is an interjection with no direct meaning, but it expresses suprise or disbelief in something. Just like "What?!" in english. It also sounds a little bit alike another english expression that could be used to express surprise, but I don't remember what it was.

## Intructions

As you scrow down the page you will see images of real projects developed by me as I exercised my skills. These images are linked to the deployed webpages developed by each project. Just click on any of them to take a better look and inspect my code.

## Credits

The whole code was written by me and it tool a lot from what I learned from freeCodeCamp, Mimo.org, W3Schools and, of course, The UofT Coding Bootcamp.

The boxsizing trick at the beggining of the styles.css code was seen on css-trick.com (https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/).

The Oh Shent! logo was created by myself on Canvas and the effect used to style my picture on "About me" section was developed on Picofme (https://picofme.io) tool.
